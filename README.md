Kalor Shishow is a collage of loosely related, poorly edited and unbalanced jokers and other cards. This is the only Balatro mod where you can commit tax evasion, do not play this mod. (Made using [Joker Forge](https://jokerforge.jaydchw.com/))

All the images used in cards were directly taken from Google Images, just as God intended.

If you have any ideas you want in the mod, or you encounter any bugs, be sure to make an [issue](https://github.com/Kalor122/Kalor-Shitshow-BALATRO-MOD-/issues) using the enhancement or bug label. (Please explain it in detail)
